# Chapter 1
Why LLMs Exploded? Self Supervised Learning

## Foundation Models
- The transition from task-specific models to general-purpose models.
- Trained on massive, diverse datasets using self-supervised learning.
- Shows abilities not explicitly programmed or anticipated.

## Three Layers of the AI Stack
- Application development
- Model development
- Infrastructure

## Comparison to ML
- Without foundation models, you have to train your own models for your applications. With AI engineering, you use a model someone else has trained for you.
- AI engineering works with models that are bigger, consume more compute resources, and incur higher latency than traditional ML engineering. This means that thereâ€™s more pressure for efficient training and inference optimization. 
- AI engineering works with models that can produce open-ended outputs. Open ended outputs give models the flexibility to be used for more tasks, but they are also harder to evaluate.
